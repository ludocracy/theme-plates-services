# ThemePlates
A way to search, organize and share recipes as part of a cooking lifestyle.

ThemePlates differs from other recipe sharing sites because it:
- Comprehends recipe instructions
  - Allows searching by cooking technique
  - Skill ratings for recipes
- Gamifies cooking
  - Rewards reputation points for posting images of finished recipes
  - Compete with others
  - High reputation users can confer badges by tasting another user's cooking in person
- Smart recipe suggestions
  - Higher engagement from users will generate superior preference data

In addition, it will support standard CRUD for recipes, posts of cooked recipes, and up/downvoting of both.
